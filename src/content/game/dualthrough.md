description: "Introducing my creation for Global Game Jam 2022: an arcade breakout clone with a twist. You're not just controlling the paddle, you're also piloting a jetpack-wearing square. While clearing out the bricks you also need to gather yellow orbs to keep the square alive. It's very simple yet incredibly fun, offering a tougher challenge than meets the eye!"
