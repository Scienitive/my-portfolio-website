description: "Welcome to my first fully released game! Your mission is simply reaching the door. Sounds straightforward, right? Well, there's a twist. When the timer resets, mechanics shift. So you need to make your plans according to that. The game features 27 levels that ramp up the challenge as you progress. Try it on Steam and see if you can beat all the levels!"
